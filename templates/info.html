  <h2>Understanding LY and ECY</h2>
  <p><strong>LY (Life Years)</strong> represent the impact of harm or surplus on human lives over time. 
     They measure how events affect the length and quality of life across generations.</p>
  <p><strong>ECY (Ecological Years)</strong> represent the impact on ecosystems and environments. 
     They measure how events affect ecological stability, sustainability, and long-term environmental health.</p>

  <h2>Harm Classifications</h2>
  <p>Each entry in the ledger is classified by intent. These categories help distinguish the nature of harm:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Negligence</strong> — harm caused by carelessness or failure to act responsibly.</li>
    <li><strong>Recklessness</strong> — harm caused by knowingly taking dangerous risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Deliberate</strong> — harm caused intentionally, with direct intent to damage or exploit.</li>
    <li><strong>Systemic</strong> — harm embedded in structures, policies, or institutions that perpetuate damage over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Cover‑up</strong> — harm compounded by concealment, denial, or obstruction of accountability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These classifications are used internally to calculate multipliers, but for public understanding they simply describe the type of intent behind each entry.</p>
