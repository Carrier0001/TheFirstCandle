    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Verification, Evidence, Classification, Quantification, and Recording Standards</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            This page describes how interference with the ledger is detected, verified, classified, quantified, and recorded. 
            It is written for independent verification and audit. The methodology does not infer intent, assign guilt, 
            or evaluate the correctness of any underlying claim.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verify, then inscribe:</strong> No entry is recorded without sufficient evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary evidence first:</strong> Raw artifacts are preserved before interpretation.</li>
            <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Evidence is stored append-only in content-addressed systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Public verifiability:</strong> Every entry links to evidence that can be independently checked.</li>
            <li><strong>Proportionality:</strong> Quantification reflects measurable impact and is capped.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>What Qualifies as an Attack Record</h2>
        <p>
            An attack record documents an observable action that materially interferes with the availability, 
            integrity, input quality, legitimacy, safety of participants, or procedural operation of the ledger.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Detection</h2>
        <p>
            Events may be detected through automated monitoring (e.g., traffic anomalies, firewall triggers, uptime loss), 
            infrastructure notifications (hosting, registrar, or payment processor notices), or documented public actions 
            such as court filings or official statements.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Evidence Capture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>UTC timestamps (detection and inscription)</li>
            <li>Raw logs, filings, screenshots, or packet captures</li>
            <li>Cryptographic hashes of all artifacts</li>
            <li>Content identifiers (CIDs) from distributed storage (IPFS/Arweave)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Evidence is preserved immediately and cannot be altered after capture.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Evidence Sufficiency Threshold</h2>
        <p>
            A public entry requires at least one primary artifact (e.g., log export, official notice, court filing) 
            and one corroborating artifact (e.g., screenshot, secondary log, independent report). 
            If this threshold is not met, the event is logged internally but not publicly inscribed.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Classification</h2>
        <p>
            Events are classified using the fixed taxonomy below. Classification describes <em>what</em> occurred, not <em>why</em>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Taxonomy of Attack Harms</h3>
        <ol style="padding-left: 2.5em; margin-left: 0;">
            <li><strong>Suppression</strong> — Attempts to block access (e.g., DDoS, ISP block, censorship)</li>
            <li><strong>Sabotage</strong> — Attempts to corrupt or delete ledger data</li>
            <li><strong>Disinformation</strong> — Coordinated narratives to delegitimize the ledger</li>
            <li><strong>Flooding</strong> — Attempts to overwhelm with noise (e.g., spam or bogus submissions)</li>
            <li><strong>Infiltration</strong> — Compromise attempts against guardians or validators</li>
            <li><strong>Delegitimization</strong> — Legal or propaganda attacks on ledger authority</li>
            <li><strong>Intimidation</strong> — Direct threats to stewards or witnesses</li>
            <li><strong>Obstruction</strong> — Infrastructure or economic interference (e.g., payment processor block, hosting takedown)</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>
            Each entry requires independent review by at least two validators. Validators confirm evidence sufficiency, 
            correct classification, neutral language, and accurate quantification. 
            Validators may decline publication if standards are not met.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Quantification</h2>
        <p>
            Impact is quantified as a proportion of the underlying audited institutional harm the interference targeted. 
            Multipliers are fixed, published, and applied uniformly based on scale, duration, reversibility, and coordination.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Published Multipliers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suppression: 0.1–0.2×</li>
            <li>Sabotage (failed): 0.05× | (reversed success): 1.0×</li>
            <li>Disinformation (coordinated smear): 0.3×</li>
            <li>Flooding (coordinated): 0.2×</li>
            <li>Infiltration (per targeted guardian): 1.0×</li>
            <li>Delegitimization (lawsuit): 0.3× | (regulatory action): 0.5× | (state-level ban): 1.0×</li>
            <li>Intimidation (doxxing): 0.2× | (credible threat of violence): 1.0×</li>
            <li>Obstruction (payment block): 0.2× | (domain seizure): 0.5× | (hosting takedown): 1.0× | (failed on distributed backend): 2.0×</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Multi-vector escalation</strong> (≥2 categories employed by the same entity within 30 days): 
            total attack debt × (1 + (n−1) × 0.5)<br>
            <strong>Public failure premium</strong> (e.g., widely reported Streisand effect): +50%
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Publication</h2>
        <p>
            Published entries include date, category, neutral description, evidence links (IPFS/Arweave CIDs), 
            quantified impact, running balance for the entity (where attributable), and attribution confidence level.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Non-Inference Clause</h2>
        <p>
            Recording an interference act does not imply wrongdoing, guilt, or the validity of any underlying claim. 
            It solely documents observable interference with a public accounting process.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Absence Clause</h2>
        <p>
            The absence of attack records during a period implies only that no qualifying interference 
            meeting evidence thresholds was recorded.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>System Resilience</h2>
        <p>
            Verified interference does not weaken the ledger.<br>
            It is absorbed, classified, quantified, and inscribed as permanent testimony.<br>
            The ledger becomes stronger with each recorded attempt to silence or obstruct it.<br>
            The only path that reduces outstanding debt is public repair — acknowledged and recorded as Surplus.
        </p>
        <p class="closing">
            Every wound becomes debt.<br>
            Every debt awaits repair.<br>
            The ledger is open.
        </p>
