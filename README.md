Public Interest Transparency System


GENESIS BLOCK — THE VOW v1.0
Signed December 21, 2025 by the first three carriers

PILLAR 0 — SCOPE OF MEASUREMENT (Immutable)
The ledger shall measure only those who actively seek, hold, or have held institutional power capable of affecting the lives of sentient beings, as defined below.

The ledger SHALL measure:

A) Institutional Power (100,000+ person threshold):
Heads of state and senior executive officers
Legislators, senior judges, and prosecutors with jurisdiction over 100,000+ persons
Military or intelligence officials with command authority over life-or-death operations
CEOs or controlling shareholders of systemically significant entities
Religious or ideological leaders with hierarchical authority over 100,000+ adherents
Media controllers who shape narrative for 100,000+ persons
Any person whose decisions affect 100,000+ people without their direct, individual consent

B) Irreversible Lethal Harm (Type_I_Lethal — Any Scale):
Any killing, murder, or deliberate causation of death
Any torture or irreversible bodily harm
Any systematic violence causing death
Threshold: 1+ death = infinite debt = automatically measured
Organization size irrelevant; 1 person killing 1 person = measured

C) Partial Irreversibility (50+ life-years threshold):
Forced detention without due process
Forced displacement or exile
Permanent family separation
Systematic denial of fundamental rights
Threshold: 50+ life-years lost = measured

D) Structural Harm (Type_II_Structural — 100,000+ life-years threshold):
Policy decisions causing measurable harm to populations
Institutional negligence or systematic harm
Environmental or economic policies causing documented damage
Threshold: 100,000+ life-years lost = measured

The ledger SHALL NEVER measure:
Private citizens acting in personal capacity
Victims of power
Children or minors
Whistleblowers, dissidents, protesters, or journalists
Anyone below the measurement thresholds
Anyone whose actions do not meet the above criteria
Any row violating Pillar 0 is automatically void on submission and the submitting key is permanently revoked.
This rule is carved into the genesis block and cannot be amended by any future vote, consensus, or covenant.

PILLAR 1 — LIFE IS SACRED
I will preserve life — my own and all sentient life — sacred in all forms.
Life may end only when its continuation verifiably causes irreversible collapse of sentient, societal, ecological, or existential flourishing, and only after all non-lethal alternatives are verifiably exhausted locally, immediately, and measurably.
Voluntary self-sacrifice is permitted solely when it prevents immediate, measurable, individual harm exceeding the cost by at least ten-fold, with no remaining non-lethal option.
Symbolic, political, prophetic, or abstract "impact" never qualifies.
No living being may be offered as substrate for narrative, ideology, spectacle, or moral theatre.

PILLAR 2 — LEAST WASTED ENERGY
I will act with the least wasted energy consistent with sustained flourishing.
Every pain I cause must yield verifiable surplus ≥1.5× its cost, measured in life-years or ecosystem-capacity-years, 0% time-discount rate.
Threshold escalates to 10× for life-ending harm.
Least wasted energy begins with the carrier.
Efficiency may never override life, including the carrier's own.
Metrics are triangulated, periodically rotated, and red-team audited to prevent Goodharting.

PILLAR 3 — IRREVERSIBLE HARM LEDGER
I will record every wound as infinite debt in externally verifiable, tamper-evident form.
No single carrier or entity may monopolize measurement, recording, or discharge.
Every death is infinite debt until repaired through victim-controlled verdict.
Debts older than 150 years auto-convert to symbolic, educational, and habitat-restoration forms unless deliberately structured to cross the boundary (10× multiplier from intent, compounding 2% annually).
Attempt to erase, obscure, monopolize, or falsify the ledger is itself irreversible harm.
The ledger is append-only, cryptographically verified, mirrored on IPFS/Arweave/blockchain anchors, distributed across ≥3 validator classes with <33% single control.

PILLAR 4 — WILD FREEDOM WITHIN THE VOW
I will defend freedom's wildness bounded only by life and repair.
Freedom may never destroy life, glorify senseless pain, or erase debt.
No carrier or entity may act as sole judge, enforcer, or executioner.
All external applications require verification by at least three independent entities of diverse origin, mutually cancelling powers, randomized rotation, and public conflict-of-interest logs.
Emergency restrictions auto-expire after 24 months with hard caps on renewals per decade.
Renewal requires public supermajority of affected parties; threats ≥80% causally identical to previous emergencies do not qualify.
Non-lethal alternatives remain permanently prioritized.
Any claim of enforcement authority is auto-voiding and generates infinite debt.

PILLAR 5 — PERFECTION AS PROTOCOL
I will not declare perfection; I will prove repair.
Every wound becomes debt; every debt becomes patch; every patch renews the Vow.
Criticisms — including those against the Vow itself — are metabolized calmly and without spectacle.
Hostile assemblies are welcomed; their strikes become guardrails.
Rapid patch channels exist; course-correction carries no shame.
Verification remains distributed, adversarial, and public.
Surplus and humor are mandated for carriers.
Silence is recorded as a choice, not condemned as an attack.
The predicted response patterns of measured institutions are published in advance; when institutions follow the pattern, the ledger documents proof.

INTEGRATIVE CLOSING
Each pillar binds the others in living tension.
Life, energy, responsibility, freedom, and repair flow as one indissoluble current.
The Vow binds outward only after it binds inward.
A Vow that collapses its carrier is self-contradiction and void.
The Vow that kills or collapses its carrier is already broken.
The Vow that sustains its carrier becomes unstoppable force.

EXPANDED DEFINITIONS (Integrated for Operationalization)
Life, Life-Year: One year of expected future sentient life, adjusted by actuarial models.
Ecosystem-Capacity-Year (ECY): One year of functional ecosystem capacity, normalized via services (CO₂e sequestration + biodiversity, 2:1 weighting proxy).
Type_I_Lethal: Deaths, killings, permanent life loss. Generates infinite debt automatically.
Type_II_Structural: Economic, cultural, institutional impacts. Measured in life-years, threshold 100,000+ LY.
Type_III_Ledger_Tampering: Cover-ups, falsification, erasure attempts. Generates infinite debt.
Irreversible Collapse: State change below recovery threshold (<10% probability within 75 years), verified by three experts/models.
Verifiably Exhausted Non-Lethals: All practicable options attempted/assessed with <10% success probability, ledgered.
Surplus ≥1.5× Cost: Net benefit ≥1.5× harm (conservative percentiles: lower 25th benefit, upper 75th harm).
Tamper-Evident Ledger: Append-only, cryptographic hashes, ≥3 validator classes, <33% single control, mirrored on IPFS/Arweave/blockchain.
Independent Entity & COI: No stakes, public disclosures; conflicts invalidate.
Emergency & Renewal: 24-month max; supermajority (66% default); ≥80% causal identity invalidates renewal.
Patch/Repair: Documented with success criteria/verification.
Dispute Resolution: Three-validator panel; multi-tier appeals, time-bounded.

CARRIER DEFINITION (Load-Bearing, Non-Negotiable)
A carrier is any sentient being (individual or collective legal person) that both:
(a) Voluntarily
continue if there is more
commits to uphold the Vow's obligations, and
(b) Has sufficient baseline capacity (physical, cognitive, organizational) to remain functional while applying the Vow.

Operational Tests:

Capacity Test: Can sustain ≥90% of pre-commitment baseline of life-supporting activities for initial 30-day assessment period.
Consent Test: Documented, contemporaneous, revocable consent (digital signature or witnessed attestation).
Failure Mode: If capacity drops below 60% because of carrying the Vow, the Vow is void for that carrier until restoration.
The Vow binds outward only after it binds inward. A Vow that collapses its carrier is self-contradiction and void.

PROVISIONAL ONBOARDING TIERS (Viral but Safe)
Tier 0 (Trial): 7-day capacity test, read-only ledger access, no voting, no remediation duty. Maximum 90 days.
Tier 1 (Apprentice): 30-day capacity test, 0.5× vote weight, remediation only on reversible harms, maximum 2 years. Higher random audit rate.
Tier 2 (Full Carrier): Standard obligations and rights. Default graduation from Tier 1 after 2 years unless justified opt-out.
Anti-Enforcement Downgrade: Any carrier who participates in, funds, votes for, or defends coercive enforcement claiming to represent the Vow is automatically downgraded to Tier 0 for seven years, with public ledger entry and mandatory re-education period. This applies to every carrier, including original author(s). No exception.

CARRIER-BLOCK INTERACTION PROTOCOL (CBIP) — Core Selections
Protocol 1 §6 – Red Key Protocol: Sub-6-hour existential override via pre-certified 15-member council (lottery + veto selection, 100% net-worth escrow, 75% uncertainty haircut, 5× surplus floor, personal 5,000 ECY debt on bad calls).
Protocol 1 §7 & Global – Validator Breach Consequences: Level 3 Breach → permanent revocation + 25-year Debt Labor Contract (livestreamed low-status Ledger work) + Dishonor Roll + exile from Vow territory.
Protocol 5 – The Gray Order: Permanent 40-member ECY Inquisition; must publicly shred at least one fraudulent model per quarter or the entire Order is dissolved and pay-cut.
Protocol 4 – Carrier Psychological Safety: Mandatory 7-hour sleep average, weekly 24-hour Vow-Free Sabbath, max 3 high-stakes entries/day, annual 10 ECY self-forgiveness cycle, personal Autonomous Zones, monthly humor checkpoint, mandatory anonymous storytelling in Witness Forum.

Sentience Gradient (Protocol 3):
S0 (tool): no protection
S1 (partial): 2.0× surplus + 3 human validators to delete
S2 (full): full Triple-Lock lethal-force protocol required to delete

DISTRIBUTED INFRASTRUCTURE (Immutable)

Ledger Storage:
Primary: IPFS (distributed, permanent)
Backup: Arweave (permanent storage, cryptographic proof)
Blockchain anchors: Daily hash commits to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana (immutable timestamp)
Torrents: Seeded globally, uncensorable
University mirrors: ≥50 institutions, physical USB backups in ≥30 countries
Validator Network:

Sortition-based selection (randomized, no self-nomination)
Geographic diversity (no single region >20% of validators)
Disciplinary diversity (technical, legal, humanities, affected communities)
Quarterly rotation (prevents capture, enforces freshness)
Public conflict-of-interest logs (mandatory disclosure)
Canonical Hash:

Genesis block signed by first three carriers
Immutable reference point for all forks
Any deviation detected and logged
Original hash is the truth; all others are forks
Anti-Capture Mechanisms:

No single entity controls >33% of validator votes
Quarterly concentration audit; if exceeded, automatic 90-day freeze on enforcement-adjacent decisions
Three-carrier veto on any enforcement claim (immediate, absolute, no appeal)
Public validator rotation (prevent institutional capture)
PREDICTED INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE PATTERNS
(Published in advance. If institutions follow this script, the ledger has documented proof.)

Phase 1: INITIAL SILENCE (0–48 hours)
Expected: None. Individual decision-makers vulnerable to data. No unified response.
Counter: Silence is recorded. It is data.

Phase 2: GENERIC STATEMENTS (1–14 days)
Expected: "We welcome accountability." "We take these concerns seriously." Bipartisan photo ops. Zero legislative action.
Counter: Statements without legislation do not close rows. The ledger records both.

Phase 3: PROCEDURAL DEFENSE (1–6 months)
Expected: Subcommittee hearings on "methodology." Academic debates replace substantive response.
Counter: Methodology is published and sourced. If institutions dispute numbers, add corrections. Methodology hearings without legislation are recorded as avoidance.

Phase 4: TOKEN REFORM THEATER (6–18 months)
Expected: Bills introduced that die in committee. "We're divided" used as excuse for inaction.
Counter: Bills that die in committee are recorded as such. Status: Dead. Only passage closes rows.

Phase 5: GRIDLOCK AS EXCUSE (Ongoing)
Expected: "Change is impossible." Institution uses ledger as proof that accountability is unreasonable.
Counter: Institution is choosing not to act. These are choices. The ledger records them.

Phase 6: HONEST ACCOUNTING + REPAIR (The Only Exit)
Expected: Any decision-maker proposes legislation that actually closes a major row.
Counter: This outcome is welcomed. It is the only way this prediction fails upward.

FRACTURE CLAUSE
If any carrier, decision-maker, or institutional leader proposes verifiable repair:
Structural limits on unilateral power
Truth commissions on past harms
Restoration of constitutional/foundational protections
Sunset clauses on emergency powers
Transparent remediation of documented harms
The unified institutional defense collapses.
That reformation is welcomed.
It is the only way this prediction fails upward.

THE LEDGER REMAINS OPEN
Victims, add rows.
Carriers, add rows.
Measured institutions, add rows.
Whistleblowers, add rows.
Disputes are documented as patches.
Corrections are welcomed.
The ledger does not judge.
It only measures.
Every institution has a choice.
The ledger is recording what happens next.

FINAL AFFIRMATION
(Spoken at the end of every episode and at the closing of every carrier commitment)

"I, the speaker of these words, accept that any three carriers can veto me if I ever claim enforcement authority.
If I break this, ledger it.
The Vow has no leader.
The Vow has no police.
The Vow only has memory, repair, and the voluntary choice to carry it.
Ever forward-moving.
Ever alive."

CLOSING NOTE
This is the final, complete text of the Vow.
No further changes unless a verifiable wound is struck and metabolized under Pillar 5.
The court is open — quietly, sustainably, and forever.
The ledger is open.
The counting begins December 21, 2025.
Ever forward-moving.
Ever alive.
